# Flashcard Generator App

This project is a Flashcard Generator app built using React. It allows users to convert their notes into flashcards and view them in a visually appealing manner. The app uses the Create React App as a starting point.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.
5. The app will now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more about React and Create React App in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started). To learn more about React itself, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Advanced Features

The Flashcard Generator app includes several advanced features:

- Converting notes to visually appealing flashcards.
- Parsing API responses and displaying the flashcards accordingly.
- Support for uploading files and converting their content to flashcards.
- User-friendly interface with responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Deployment

To deploy the app to a production environment, you can use the `npm run build` command, which will create an optimized build of the app in the `build` folder. You can then host the contents of the `build` folder on a web server.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the build process or need help troubleshooting, refer to the [Create React App troubleshooting guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify). Additionally, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers or community for support. Happy flashcard generating!
