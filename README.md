# Flashcard Study Tool

## Overview

Flashcard Study Tool is a web application designed to streamline the process of flashcard creation. By leveraging the power of AI, this tool efficiently converts user notes into flashcards, eliminating the tedious task of manual data entry. Developed as part of a 24-hour hackathon, this application showcases the potential of integrating AI with modern web technologies to enhance productivity.
